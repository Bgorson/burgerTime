# BurgerTime

Burger Time is an app that allows users to submit the burger of their choice into a text field and add it to a SQL database. Entries from the database are displayd with a "devour" button next to them. When a user "devours" a burger, it is moved to the right side of the screen and is no longer "devourable".
